      "57. R-5 fares no better in his actions. Overzealousness to take action against the petitioners and\n",
      "inertia to take action against the oppressors of the petitioners are clear from his conduct. Despite\n",
      "the petitioners being wrongfully confined by the agitating mob, R-5 stated before the WBHRC that\n",
